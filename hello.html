        <h2>About Myself</h2>
        
        <blockquote>NO QUESTIONS ARE SILLY,<br>
            NO QUESTIONS ARE STUPID,<br>
            IF ASKED, THEN ...<br>
            THE LEARNER IS LEARNING<br>
            TREADING THE RIGHT PATH <br>TOWARDS GAINING KNOWLEDGE</blockquote>
            <p>I strongly believe in the above quotes. And this is Shalini Mittal, one who is going to be your coach, your friend, for next few months. Ofcourse before we begin would you like to know me? I am interesting, funny, silly at times, but I promise you will enjoy the learning path. <br>We all are in this together interacting with each other asking questions as much as we want. Remember if you dont ask, I have lots of questions for you. Thats the reason I like to call myself "The CURIOUS GEORGE". And I really would love to call my participants  "THE CURIOUS GEORGE" TOO. <br>So are we all IN? Are we all SET? <br>GET SET READY, to know a bit more about me!!!
