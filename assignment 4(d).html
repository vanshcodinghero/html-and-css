		<blockquote><b>MONUMENTS I VISITED</b></blockquote>
		
		<h1>GATEWAY OF INDIA-INDIA</h1>
		<img width="1500" height="800"src="gateway of india.jpg">
		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>The gateway was built to commemorate the arrival of George V, Emperor of India and Mary of Teck, Empress consort, in India at Apollo Bunder, Mumbai (then Bombay) on 2 December 1911 prior to the Delhi Durbar of 1911; 
		it was the first visit of a British monarch to India.
		However, they only got to see a cardboard model of the monument, as construction did not begin until 1915.Before the gateway's construction, Apollo Bunder used to serve a native fishing ground.
		The foundation stone for the gateway was laid on 31 March 1913 by then governor of Bombay, Sir George Sydenham Clarke with the final design of George Wittet for the gateway sanctioned in August 1914.
		Between 1915 and 1919 work continued at the Apollo Bunder to reclaim the land on which the gateway was to be built, along with the construction of a sea wall.
		Gammon India had undertaken construction work for the gateway. Its foundations were completed in 1920 while construction was finished in 1924.
		The gateway was opened to the public on 4 December 1924 by then viceroy, Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading.
		Following Indian independence, the last British troops to leave India, the First Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry, passed through the gateway with a 21-gun salute, as part of a ceremony on 28 February 1948,
		signalling the end of the British Raj.
		<br>N. Kamala, professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, refers to the gateway as a "jewel in the crown" and a "symbol of conquest and colonisation". 
		The monument commemorates the legacy of British colonial rule, namely the first visit of a British monarch to India and its use as an entry point for prominent colonial personnel into British India.
		Today the gateway is synonymous with the city of Mumbai. Since its construction, the gateway has remained amongst the first structures visible to visitors arriving in Bombay by the sea.
		<br>Since 2003, the gateway has been the location for the local Jewish community to light the menorah for Hanukkah celebrations every year.
		This ritual was started by Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg of the chabad in Mumbai (located in Nariman House). 
		It also became a site for prayers following the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks which targeted, amongst others, Nariman House. Rabbi Holtzberg lost his life in the 2008 terror attacks.</p>
		<h2>Features I liked about the monument</h2>
		<p>The gateway's arch has a height of 26 metres (85 feet) with its central dome being 15 metres (49 feet) in diameter.The monument is built of yellow basalt and reinforced concrete.
		 The stones were sourced locally while the perforated screens were brought in from Gwalior. The monument faces towards the Mumbai Harbour.
		 There are four turrets on the structure of the gateway, and there are steps constructed behind the arch of the gateway which lead to the Arabian Sea. 
		The monument features intricate stone latticework (also known as the jali work). The Scottish architect, George Wittet combined elements of the Roman triumphal arch and 16th-century architecture of Gujarat.
		The architecture also combines indigenous architectural elements with elements of Islamic architecture, known as the Indo-Saracenic.
		The harbour front was realigned in order to make an esplanade, which would sweep down to the centre of the town. 
		On each side of the arch, there are large halls with the capacity to hold 600 people.The cost of the construction was ₹21 lakhs (two million one hundred thousand rupees), borne by the then government.
		Due to a paucity of funds, the approach road was never built. Hence, the gateway stands at an angle to the road leading up to it.</p>

		<h1>INDIA GATE-INDIA</h1>
		<img width="1500" height="800"src="india gate.jpg">
		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>The India Gate was part of the work of the Imperial War Graves Commission (I.W.G.C), which came into existence in December 1917 for building war graves and memorials to soldiers who were killed in the First World War
		The foundation stone of the gate, then called the All India War Memorial, was laid on 10 February 1921, at 16:30, by the visiting Duke of Connaught in a ceremony attended by Officers and Men of the British Indian Army,
		Imperial Service Troops, the Commander in Chief, and Chelmsford, the viceroy.On the occasion, the viceroy is reportedly to have said, "The stirring tales of individual heroism, will live for ever in the annals of this
		country", and that the memorial which was a tribute to the memory of heroes, "known and unknown", would inspire future generations to endure hardships with similar fortitude and "no less valour". The Duke also read out 
		a message by the King, which said, "On this spot, in the central vista of the Capital of India, there will stand a Memorial Archway, designed to keep", in the thoughts of future generations, "the glorious sacrifice of 
		the officers and men of the British Indian Army who fought and fell". During the ceremony, the Deccan Horse, 3rd Sappers and Miners, 6th Jat Light Infantry, 34th Sikh Pioneers, 39th Garhwal Rifles, 59th Scinde Rifles 
		(Frontier Force), 117th Mahrattas, and 5th Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force), were honoured with title of "Royal" in recognition of the distinguished services and gallantry of the British Indian Army during the Great War".
		<br>Ten years after the foundation stone laying ceremony, on 12 February 1931, the memorial was inaugurated by Lord Irwin, who on the occasion said "those who after us shall look upon this monument may learn in pondering
		its purpose something of that sacrifice and service which the names upon its walls record." In the decade between the laying of foundation stone of the memorial and its inauguration, the rail-line was shifted to run 
		along the Yamuna river, and the New Delhi Railway Station was opened in 1926.
		<br>The gate, which is illuminated every evening from 19:00 to 21:30, today serves as one of Delhi's most important tourist attractions. Cars travelled through the gate earlier, until it was closed to trafficThe Republic
		Day Parade starts from Rashtrapati Bhavan and passes around the India Gate.India gate is also a popular spot for civil society protests in New Delhi, with historical protests being against the Nirbhaya rape case, Unnao 
		rape case, and the anti-corruption movement, inter alia.In 2017, the India Gate was twinned with the Arch of Remembrance in Leicester, Englandanother Lutyens war memorial, following a very similar design but on a 
		smaller scale. In a ceremony, India's high commissioner to the United Kingdom laid a wreath at the arch in Leicester and the British high commissioner to India laid one at the India Gate.</p>
		<h2>Features I liked about the monument</h2>
		<p>The memorial-gate was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who was not only the main architect of New Delhi, but a leading designer of war memorials. He was a member of the I.W.G.C., and one of Europe's foremost designers 
		of war graves and memorials. He designed sixty-six war memorials in Europe, including the highly regarded cenotaph, in London, in 1919, the first national war memorial erected after World War I, for which he was 
		commissioned by David Lloyd George, the British prime minister. The memorial in New Delhi, like the Cenotaph in London, is a secular memorial, free of religious and "culturally-specific iconography such as crosses". 
		Lutyens according to his biographer, Christopher Hussey, relied on "elemental mode", a style of commemoration based on "universal architectural style free of religious ornamentation".
		<br>The India gate, which has been called a "creative reworking of the Arc de Triomphe" has a span of 30 feet, and lies on the eastern axial end of Kingsway, present day Rajpath, the central vista and main ceremonial 
		procession route in New Delhi. The 42-metre (138-foot)-tall India gate, stands on a low base of red Bharatpur stone and rises in stages to a huge moulding. The shallow domed bowl at the top was intended to be filled 
		with burning oil on anniversaries but this is rarely done.The memorial-gate hexagon complex, with a diameter of about 625 metres, covers approximately 306,000 m² in area.</p>
		<h3>Amar Jawan Jyoti</h3>
		<p>Amar Jawan Jyoti, or the flame of the immortal soldier, is a structure consisting of black marble plinth, with reversed L1A1 Self-loading rifle, capped by war helmet, bound by four urns, each with the permanent light 
		(jyoti) from compressed natural gas flames, erected under the India gate to commemorate Indian soldiers martyred in the war of the liberation of Bangladesh in December 1971. It was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister
		Indira Gandhi on 26 January 1972, the twenty-third Indian Republic Day.Since the installation of the Amar Jawan Jyoti, it has served as India's tomb of the unknown soldier.It is manned round the clock by the Indian armed
		forces.Wreaths are placed at the Amar Jawan Jyoti every Republic Day, Vijay Diwas, and Infantry Day by the Prime Minister and the Chiefs of the Armed Forces. Infantry Day is the day Indian infantry air landed at Srinagar
		on 27 October 1947 to stop and defeat the Pakistani mercenaries' attack on Jammu and Kashmir. The sixty-eighth Infantry Day was marked by wreath laying ceremony by Chief of Army Staff, General Dalbir Singh, and by Lt. 
		General Chandra Shekhar (Retd.) on behalf of infantry veterans.</p>
